        <p class="description">
            When a user first signs into Eyrie, GitHub asks if they wish to give Eyrie permission to access details of their account.
            Eyrie only requests the data necessary to operate, namely, the list of repositories the user has access to and their username.
            When a commit is pushed to a repository watched by Eyrie, any text documents (such as .txt or .md) are copied into Eyrie's database for browsing.
            Eyrie keeps no copies of code files.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
            Users who wish to remove a repository from Eyrie may go to the repositority's settings screens in Eyrie and click "delete".
            This will delete all copied documents from Eyrie's database.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
            Users can disconnect their GitHub account from Eyrie at any time by visiting <a href="{% url 'social:disconnect' 'github' %}">this URL</a>.
            However, because Eyrie depends on GitHub to function, disconnected users will need to sign in again if they wish any private repositories in Eyrie.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
            Eyrie's code is <a href="https://github.com/ZeroCater/Eyrie">open source</a>, so you can review it for yourself.
            Eyrie is hosted on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/home">Heroku</a>.
